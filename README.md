# Hacknado
```Hacknado Hackathon Submission: Gaurav, Swayam, and Elisabeth```

>>> A place where you can share resources on the environment, focus on study and works towards reducing your carbon footprint. Grow Green!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this app comes from one of our member's sisters. Because of ADHD, she struggles with time management skills. We also wanted to tie it to the environment to fit with the theme of Hacknado, as well as increase awareness about a very important issue. 
## What it does
The app helps you stay off your phone while you study, and it also helps you organize your tasks. During study breaks, the app provides articles, facts, and other resources on the environment. When you reach a certain amount of study hours, a tree is planted, reducing your carbon footprint!
##How we built it 
We have built our hack using Javascript, HTML, CSS,  3rd party APIs, and Twilio.
## Challenges we ran into
Because we were all in different time zones and relatively new to hackathons, we ran into a few roadblocks building our app, and it was a slower process than expected! Luckily, all of our teammates pulled their weight and our app turned out really well.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an international team and demoing this app! For the two of us, this is our first hackathon. 
## What we learned
Team member 1(Elisabeth): This was my first hackathon, and I learned how important teamwork is. Even though time differences made it difficult to work with my team, I thought we worked really well together, and we got a lot done! I felt like my teammates really valued my ideas, and I really valued their coding experience. 
Team member 2(Swayam): This was my first hackathon, and I worked with people from different time zones. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot about team management, version control, and errors in production. It was a great experience with lots of errors and lots of debugging.  
Team member 3(Gaurav): This was my second hackathon, and I learned tons about collaboration, git in a somewhat of a workspace environment, team management, web dev, making responsive websites, and most importantly working together as a group to tackle a given problem. This hackathon was truly a great experience. Although we did encounter a lot of errors, good communication aided us with solving them. 
## What's next for Grow Green
Grow Green would like to partner with a non-profit so we can actually plant trees for people who use our app. We would like to develop a more extensive backend as well and get the app on the app store.
